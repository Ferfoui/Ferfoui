## Who am I?

I'm @Ferfoui, I'm a student very interested by programming, I like video games and embedded softwares.

Mathematics is also one of my favorite subjects, it is so interesting to discover this beautiful universe.

## Mastered Programming Languages

**Java** *(I love Java, it is the OOP paradise)*

**Kotlin** *(very cool language, close enough to Java, but with some nice features)*

## Other things

âš¡ I'm also interested in electronics, I like to make small projects with ESP32 and STM32.

ðŸ¤– I also like robotics. I've participated to [FRC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) competitions with the [team 9220](https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/team/9220), and I went to New York for the [2025 NYC Regional](https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/2025/NYNY), it was a great experience!

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Rust, I'm trying to improve my skills in Java and I'm also learning Mandarin Chinese (It's more difficult than Java).

ðŸŽ® I like to play video games, I also like to meet new people and to learn new things.
